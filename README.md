# Installation

Remember that your code will be transpilled, so you can install type script using the flag '-D':

```
npm install -D typescript
```


# Type inference

TypeScript can know the type of a variable by inference.

And as you can see in the previous image, one type a type is infered, it can be changed. In other words, you can't pass as example a number to a string variable (do not mind if the type was inferred).
